<h2>TODO Items <h2>
<ul>
<li>testing branch works on windows PC but not on my macbook - have been blocked on issue for couple hours - this is perhaps where docker environment would have been useful. Will try fo solutions again in a couple days if not may look to setting up docker env to see if that solves issue.<li>
