In this personal project, I leveraged <a href='https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/gpt' target='_blank'>OpenAI's GPT 3.5 Turbo API</a> with some prompt engineering to create AI **conversation** and **code** generation features.

<a href='https://replicate.com/' target='_blank'>Replicate AI</a> models were used to create the AI-generated **photo**, **music**, and **video** features.

This application is designed as a Software-as-a-Service utilizing a subscription model. Stripe and Clerk integration provides users with trusted and secure payments and authentication.

_This application is intended for learning as well as displaying my software engineering ability_. **This application is not intended to be used as an actual product or means of creating profit.** The Stripe integration remains in developer/test mode to prevent actual sales of services.

<h3>Known Issues</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Video and music generation may have increased generation times (in minutes) due to cold starts with the particular AI Model API. These generations are significantly improved after the first generation of that particular feature.</li>
</ul>
